### Not really my Github Profle...

This is just a TODO app that I use mostly to keep track of gaming tasks that reset daily or weekly.

Another TODO apps usually let you unmark a task that is DONE, but I wanted it to automatically unmark the tasks when the game resets them.

This runs using Svelte and it's data is offline in the browser storage. Feel free to use it if you like it.
